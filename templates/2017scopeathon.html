                    <h4> Use Data. Solve Problems. Do good. </h4>
                    <p>South Side Civic a <a href="https://capp-sites.uchicago.edu/" target="_blank" style="color:#87CAEB">CAPP</a>-student led group is partnering with UChicago’s Institute of Politics (IOP), Department of Computer Science, and the Harris School's CAPP program to host the Third Annual UChicago Civic ScopeAthon!</p>

                    <p>While traditional hackathons are about writing code, a scopeathon focuses on understanding the purpose and use of technology in helping solve problems. Before anyone writes a line of code, it’s crucial to understand what a technology solution needs to accomplish. This understanding bridges developers and organization representatives, and the scopeathon strengthens this cross-discipline awareness.</p>

                    <h4>  The ScopeAthon Mission </h4>

                     <p>The main objectives of the ScopeAthon are to form cross-functional teams to scope out problems faced by civic organizations, break the problems down into manageable parts and develop a plan to address them. The solutions may or may not be entirely tech-oriented, or only parts of the solution may have a tech component.</p>

                    <p>The event brings together leaders of civic organizations, students, and community members to learn about civic hacking, civic problems, and how to work in teams to form a solution. Participants come from various backgrounds, including, but not limited to, computer science, political science and public policy, economics, geography, visual art, civic innovation and leadership, etc.</p>

                    <ul class="list-arrow-right">

                        <li>Learn and exercise problem-scoping skills</li>
                        <li>Meet civic leaders in active organizations</li>

                    <h4>Solving Civic Problems with Data</h4>
                    <p>Denice W. Ross is a Public Interest Technology Fellow at New America.  She specializes in data transparency and civic engagement, with a focus on action at the local level.</p><p> Before joining New America, Ross was a senior advisor in the Obama White House, where she leveraged data and innovation to improve the effectiveness and sustainability of community-based federal programs. As a presidential innovation fellow in 2014, she co-founded the White House Police Data Initiative, one of the most tangible responses to the 21st Century Policing Task Force report, and she worked with the Department of Energy on crowdsourcing private-sector data to improve community resilience in disaster-impacted areas. Earlier, she served as director of enterprise innovation for the City of New Orleans, where she built a digital services team and established open data as the cornerstone for performance management and public engagement. </p>
                    <p>
                    Prior to her roles in government, Ross co-directed the Greater New Orleans Community Data Center (GNOCDC), a non-profit data intermediary and member of the Urban Institute’s National Neighborhood Indicators Partnership. When Hurricane Katrina propelled New Orleans into the national spotlight, Ross collaborated with Brookings to track the city’s recovery through The New Orleans Index. In addition, she actively participated in numerous post-Katrina community planning initiatives, and co-founded the first new childcare center after the storm.</p>
                        <p>Denice Ross will speak on Friday, October 6, 2017. The location and time are TBD.</p>

Through sustainable farming and educational programs in nutrition, movement yoga and the arts, we foster creativity, wellness and empowerment for individuals in the community as a whole. <br>
                  <b>Challenge: </b> I Grow Chicago is developing a case management system to better track our community's successes and needs. They are looking for help developing key metrics they should be tracking, the best system to use, and an implementation timeline and scope. Because they hire primarily from the Englewood community, a large barrier for this project is computer literacy of staff. A large part of this project will be in determining a system with an easy user interface and in staff training and development.</p>

                                  <p>The main objective of our ScopeAthon is to take a civic-minded or community-based problem and to form committed groups to scope out the problem, breaking it down into its parts and developing a plan to address the problem. The solutions may or may not be entirely tech-oriented, or only parts of the solution may have a tech component.</p>

                                  <p>At our Civic ScopeAthon you will gain problem-scoping skills, learn about other civic-tech organizations, network with community leaders, and join a team and enjoy the thrill and excitement of a hackathon.</p>

                                  <p>Saturday’s workshops build upon one another to provide a “problem-scoping toolkit” by the end of the event. Coming for just the afternoon or just the morning will diminish your opportunity to fully engage in the scopeathon. So, email us if you have concerns about scheduling conflicts.
